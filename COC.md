# Portland Elm Meetup Code of Conduct

## Purpose

As participants in this meetup, we are here to talk about the Elm programming language, to share our experiences, celebrate each others’ successes, and to help each other learn.

## Harassment, bullying, and discrimination

We endeavor to create an inclusive space where people from diverse backgrounds will be welcomed and respected and can trust each other to act politely, in kindness, and in good faith. We do not allow harassment, bullying, or discrimination, which include:

* sustained disruption, especially of presenters and study groups
* derisive, abusive, or exclusionary language, even in jokes
* unwanted sexual attention
* stalking, unwanted photography or recording
* sexual language, imagery, or behavior
* violence or threat of violence
* incitement to any of the above

If you experience or are witness to harassment, bullying, or discrimination, please act promptly. Subtle offenses may be pointed out in the moment and the offending member asked to stop. If you are asked to stop, please comply immediately. You may also submit a report privately to the host, either in person at the end of the event or through [a Meetup message to the organizer](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Elm-Meetup/).

Behavior that is overtly malicious or puts another member in danger should be reported immediately to the host. The host is empowered to hold members accountable to this code of conduct and provide for the safety of its members, up to and including:

* asking offending members to stop
* soliciting additional reports from witnesses and offending members
* issuing warnings to offending members
* expelling offending members from the group
* ejecting offending members from the venue

We observe this code of conduct in group communications as well as at in-person events.

## Social Rules

We observe [The Recurse Center’s Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules). In short, they are:

* no feigning surprise
* no well-actuallys
* no backseat driving
* no subtle-isms

These rules require more interpretation and won’t be enforced the same way as the harassment, bullying, and discrimination policy. Instead, when Social Rules are broken, we will gently suggest kinder, more constructive ways of communicating with one another.

## Meetup’s guidelines

Meetup provides [basic community guidelines](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000683791-Community-Guidelines) that prohibit events that are targeted at minors or promote violent or criminal activity. [Meetup does not take any responsibility](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027447252#h_eb0138c9-3e8d-43c7-99f1-3c3cf479d38a) for what happens at these events and [encourages participants to contact the organizer](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001673631-Harassment-and-bullying-offline) when its users experience harassment or bullying.

This code of conduct does not supersede Meetup’s terms or policies. However, Meetup’s terms and policies are not sufficient on their own. The purpose of this code is to augment them.
