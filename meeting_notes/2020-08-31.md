## September and October

* Ian Mackenzie will present elm-3d-scene and elm-geometry in September.
* Ian’s on ET, so we will be meeting at 6pm PT.
* Michael will be presenting in October.

## Elm SPA

* The idea of components has been avoided in the Elm community [because it can lead to object-oriented patterns](https://changelog.com/podcast/218#transcript-67)
* Modules work best as an abstract concept around a piece of information, the less stateful the better:
    * [The Changelog, Episode #218](https://changelog.com/podcast/218#transcript-73)
    * [Life of a file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpDsk374LDE)
* Stateful components are possible by "swapping component brains" into TEA of a parent component
    * This technique is used [in the `elm-spa-example`](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Main.elm)
    * A simpler example can be seen in Lunar Rocks
      * [Account form](https://github.com/codyshepherd/lunar-rocks/blob/devel/client/src/Page/Settings/Account.elm)
      * [Password subform](https://github.com/codyshepherd/lunar-rocks/blob/devel/client/src/Page/Settings/Account/Password.elm)
    * The technique is [discouraged in the Elm docs](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Platform-Cmd#fancy-stuff)
* Components as boring functions
  * Maybe we can keep all of the state and state management in the parent component, and have components that are just boring functions
  * [elm-spa guide](https://www.elm-spa.dev/guide/components)
    * No data example
    * Passing in data
    * Passing in msgs
    * Carousel example
      * We want a carousel that can take any kind of data, it just knows about doing carousel things and provides an API for that
      * Carousel implementation
        * Good technique: Internals are not exposed
        * Good technique: Type variable `slide` guarantees slides all have the right type, but the carousel does not modify the slides

## Misc.

* Brian is doing technical writing for [Fission](https://fission.codes/), a functional-friendly company that recently published [this interesting article](https://blog.fission.codes/auth-without-backend/) on serverless authentication.
* [Dillon Kearns live codes on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dillonkearns)

## Study group notes

* Adam is still working on his checkers app:
	* Need a recursive tree of possible jump moves.
	* The tree needs to represent the board after each jump.
	* It currently doesn’t, which opens up the possibility of infinite recursion due to jumping back over previously jumped pieces.
