* Adam’s goal for December (one of the following):
	* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Elm
	* Solve an [Elevator Saga](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/) challenge in Elm. (This may not be realistic as it would require either an elaborate integration with the host page or porting the elevator JavaScript).
	* Rewrite checkers false start by modeling turns independent of moves.
* Brian’s goals for next time:
	* Learn Elm parser for separating parts of punctuated words in Russian language app.
